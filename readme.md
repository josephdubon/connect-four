## Assessment: Connect Four Team Project
Assessment: Connect Four

In Connect Four, one player is assigned Red and the other player is assigned Black. Players alternate inserting their pieces into one of the 7 columns of a 7x6 grid. The first player to get four of their pieces in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), wins.

In the physical world, the grid is placed perpendicular to the playing table, such that the pieces fall to the bottom and stack upon each other. Your digital version of the game should yield the same end result (the falling animation is optional).

The game can end in a tie, meaning all cells are filled but no player achieved four-in-a-row.

Implement Connect Four using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In each game, the players will be sitting at the same mouse & keyboard, alternating turns.
Submission Details

You will work in groups to complete your Connect Four implementation. You should all code individually, but work together in building the layout and functionality of your game.

As a member of a group, you will have to meet certain performance expectations. Your performance will be evaluated by the other members of your group, so be sure to try to contribute equally to the project! You can read more here: Guidelines for Individuals on a Team

The project lead will submit the project. This will be a project you include in your portfolio, so make it look nice, and use GitLab's Pages feature to host your finished game so that anyone can play it.

#### How to Break Down a Project

1. Read the requirements document in detail.
	a. Take notes of important points.
	b. Write down your questions.
2. Answer your questions!
3. Make a development plan.
	a. Describe the entire behavior of the program in 3 (or at most 4) steps. Don't use any JavaScript words!
	b. Break down each item into 4 (or 4) smaller steps by asking the question, "How?".
	c. Repeat until it's obvious how to turn the step into JS code.
4. Write the code!
